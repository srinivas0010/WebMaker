# WebMaker App

**WebMaker** is a web application that allows users to create fully customizable websites using the latest technologies. The application is built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and leverages the **Claude API** for backend intelligence, enabling dynamic website generation, content suggestions, and customizations.
**There is a priview section where you can run your application using WEBSOCKETS

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

You will need to set up environment variables for both the frontend and backend.

#### Backend
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
```bash
PORT=5000
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
```

#### Frontend
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 4. Start the Application

## Usage

WebBuilder allows you to easily create and customize websites with just a few clicks. Here's how it works:

1. **Start
2. **Create a New Website**: Start a new website project, and WebBuilder will guide you through selecting templates, adding pages, and customizing your site.
3. **Dynamic Content Creation**: Using the Claude API, WebBuilder generates intelligent suggestions for content, structure, and design.
4. **Customize and Deploy**: Adjust the design, content, and settings of your website before deploying it live.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, JSX, CSS, HTML, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **API**: Claude API for content generation and intelligent backend calls
- **Environment**: Websockets

---

## API Integration

WebBuilder integrates with the **Claude API** for dynamic backend functionality. The Claude API powers features such as:

- **Content Generation**: Automatically generates website content based on user inputs.
- **Design Assistance**: Provides intelligent suggestions for layout and design customization.
- **SEO Optimization**: Suggests SEO-friendly content and structure for better ranking.

### Claude API Usage

#### Backend (Node.js)
In the `backend` folder, you'll find the API routes that interact with Claude.

Example API call using Claude for content generation:
```js
const axios = require('axios');

const generateContent = async (userInput) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('https://api.claude.ai/generate', {
      apiKey: process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY,
      prompt: userInput,
    });

    return response.data.content;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating content with Claude:', error);
  }
};
```

This function interacts with the Claude API to generate content based on user input.
